# WEB PAGE OF COURSES 🕸️ 📄 🧑‍🎓

The web page show a site where the users can buy different courses of different fields as programming, cook, plants, and so on. 

I developed the shopping cart so the user can click on the button "Agregar al carrito" and the course will be added to the shopping cart list, in case they buy the course more than one time the counter will increase, there are the options to delete each course just clicking on the "X" mark or delete all the list of courses of the cart clicking the option "Vaciar carrito".
